# Python Data Struction Exerciese

![CI Status](https://travis-ci.org/DigitalPig/data_structure.svg?branch=master)

This is a repo that holds my attempts to do the exercises in this [awesome python data structure book](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html).

Currently, I have all chapters before the Graph chapter. Still working on the graph chapter.
